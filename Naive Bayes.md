### Naive Bayes

#### Bayes Theory

Core concept of Bayes theory is always accepted the genre with the highest possibility over all.

Notation: 
$$
p(x|c)
$$
That is possiblity of event x happened with regard to c. We interpreted it as, the possibility of event x happed with regard to c, is the possiblity of event x and c, divided by possiblity of c.
$$
P(x|c)=\frac{P(x \& c)}{P(c)}
$$




And when we have the possiblity of P(x|c), which can be calculated as
$$
p(c|x)=\frac{p(x|c)p(c)}{p(x)}
$$
